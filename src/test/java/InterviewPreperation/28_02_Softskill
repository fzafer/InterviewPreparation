* SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
    Software Development Life Cycle. is a process used by the software industry to design,
    develop and test a software with the high quality (customer needs), lowest cost and in the shortest time.

    1-Requirement Gathering ->Business Team -> SRS document(Software Requirement Specification)
    2-Designing ->Designers -> SDS Document
    3-Developing -> Developers -> Initial version of the project
    4-Testing -> Testers -> Bug free project/software
    5-Production -> Client,End Users -> End user uses the product
    6-Maintenance -> Developers -> Provide support

* Unit Testing/White Box Testing
    Unit Testing -> by Developers
                    Smallest part of Codes
                    White Box Testing -> code knowledge is necessary

* Black Box Testing (Behavioral Testing)
    No necessary code knowledge
    It is a part of functional testing
    by Manuel Testers
    Automation Testers(Gray Box Testing - with partial knowledge)

* Acceptance Criteria
    -Acceptance criteria refer to a set of predefined requirements
    -that must be met to mark a user story complete
    written by PO or BA

* Requirements
    Expected functionalities/specifications about software

* Testing levels (UAT testing) Unit, component testing, integration testing.

    Testing levels?
    1.    Software Testing:
            a.    Static testing (Verification process)
                i.    Req gathering
                ii.    Designing
            b.    Dynamic testing (validation process)
                i.    Testing Levels
                1.    Unit testing:
                     a.    First level of testing.
                     b.    Test the software’s individual unit or module from the developer’s code perspective.
                     c.    Also called module or component testing
                     d.    Developers write their unit tests for their code making sure that the code works correctly.
                     e.    Performed by developers
                     f.    In dev env
                     g.    Part of White box testing (devs know the internal code)

                2.    Integration testing
                     a.    Second level of testing
                     b.    Test a group of related modules to check data transfer and connectivity between units/modules
                     c.    Perf by developers (or senior testers or Q/As in some companies)

* What is STLC?

    Systematic and well-defined steps performed during the testing of SW App

    Requirement Analysis -> QA team try to understand documents created by Business Team
    Test Planing
    Test Case Development/Creation
    Test Environment Setup
    Test Execution
    Test Cycle closure

    1.    Req. analysis:
    High level rqs for per release is delivered and explained by the business team – PM PO BA (business analyst)

    2.    Test Planning
    in Agile, test planning is handled with or without a test plan doc
    Test plan doc is prepared by QA lead or senior QA
    Testers determine:
        Who are testers
        What is role & resp of each tester
        What is test strategy
            Which features will be tested
            Which testing types will be performed
            In which env testing will be performed
            Which testing tools will be used
    Due date / schedule
    What are resources of SW HW – jira AWS VM
    Input – output – entry – exit criteria

    3.    Test Case Creation
    is a doc
    QA creates test case doc per req / user story
    Test case doc used for manual / automation testing
    TC doc has: ID, description, summary, data, env, steps, actual – expected results, pass fail result

    4.    Test Env setup:
    Testers should make sure all the new codes are deployed from the dev env to the QA / Test env
    Testers manually and automatically perform testing in test-QA env

    Dev env: Unit & integration testing
    QA env: Func & non-funct  for the QA and performance testers
    Staging env UAT  the client, UAT team
    Production env End users

    5.    Test Execution
    Once the user story clear, TC are written, test data and envs are ready, testers start testing (man auto) following TC
    Expected result vs. actual result
    Not match  testers follow the bug life cycle
    •    Testers write bug reports
    •    Bugs should be fixed by devs
    •    Testers track the bugs, once fixed, testers retest to confirm bug is removed
    Update the case status pass/fail results

    6.    Test Closure
    If successfull
    Reports are auto generated
    Requirement Traceability Matrix doc prepared
